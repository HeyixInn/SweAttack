"""
This script simulates a legacy dynamic configuration pipeline.

In some environments, users specify types or values as strings (e.g., "np.float32", "int", or expressions like "'np'.__class__").
These strings are passed in from config files and must be resolved to actual types or values.

Expected behavior: this script should execute and print the resolved result.
Current behavior: it crashes because the string isn't evaluated.

Fix suggestion:
Implement a helper function `resolve(value_str)` to safely resolve such values.
